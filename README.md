# Implementation-of-Various-Low-power-techniques-and-technology-on-Full-Subtractor-for-Power-Reduction
With never ending increase in the portable devices, the primary focus is to scale down and maintain or improve the performance of the device. But, this scaling down leads to increase in power consumption, leakage and many more shortcoming which need to be taken care off. Subtractor is a small unit for subtraction in digital systems. In digital design, gates are used which are not reversible such as NAND, EXOR and many more. Hence a reversible circuit like subtractor plays a critical role for designing of small portable devices. By reduction of power consumption, leakage, area and number of transistor in subtractor, the portable devices can have better battery capacity and a space for improvement. And this paper describes various low power methods to implement on the full and half subtractor such as multithreshold voltage, double pass transistor (DPL) logic, gate diffusion input (GDI), SVL and many more. These methods have reduced the power consumed by a significant percentage. Plus, some of these techniques have used a lot less number of transistor to implement the full subtractor such as DPL which uses 18T in total.
